\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%State of art
Monocular vision has been demonstrating a flourishing field in autonomous vehicles.\\ Several applications has presented excellent 
solutions to problems presented nowadays. Therefore, this research contributes with an innovation, using Particle Image 
Velocimetry(PIV)\cite{Bastiaans} and Pearson's Correlation Coefficient(PCC)\cite{Miranda Neto}.\\ The proposal is follow objects in scene and
stipulate its relative velocity utilizing the both techniques cited above.These parameters are calculated in 2 and 3 dimensions and
generate a coefficient relative to velocity of approaching and removal of objects.

Matlab is software used to simulations. PIV went the most important point of the beginning this project, considering the applications 
with it.\\ Generally, this technique is utilised to calculate the field of velocity in fluids. Thus, it's possible to calcule the field
of velocity of any objects that moves in scene. So, PIV was adjusted for situation to autonomous vehicles, using PCC and bank of dates of 
KITTI\cite{Geiger}.

\section{Conclusion}
PIV has presented satisfactory results. Different kinds of information that can be concluded, like: estimate collision, tracking of
objects in 2 or 3 dimensions and factor of approaching and removal. The simulations in Matlab has given promissories results: (TABLES
and GRAPHICS).

PIV is great tool to analizy tracking and velocity of objects and it shows an exepcional field to develop different ways to
solve the problems of applicability in autonomous vehicles.
