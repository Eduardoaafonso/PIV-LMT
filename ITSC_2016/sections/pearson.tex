\subsection{PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT - PCC}

PCC is used in statistical analyses, pattern recognition and computer vision. 
Applications include disparity measurement and object recognition, comparing two images. The followed equation
describes PCC for monochrome digital images\cite{Eugene}:

\begin{equation}$$
\centering
\everymath{\displaystyle}
$r_i = \frac{\sum\limits_i (x_i-x_m)(y_i-y_m)}{\sqrt{\sum\limits_i (x_i-x_m)^2} \sqrt{\sum\limits_i (y_i-y_m)^2}}
$
$$\end{equation}

Where, $x_i$ is the intensity of the i-th pixel in image 1, $y_i$ is the intensity of the i-th pixel in image 2, $x_m$ is 
the mean intensity of image 1, and $y_m$ is the mean intensity of image 2 \cite{Miranda Neto}.
