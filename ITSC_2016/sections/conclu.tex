From the presented examples,
it is possible to see that one application that uses the tracking
and the departure factor is related with risk of collision.
It is possible to estimate how of fast an object is departing,
and thus, if the  departure factor tends to zero or 
if the velocity of departure factor changes to lower negatives values every time, 
probably, there is a high risk of collision.

The $PIV$ technique has presented satisfactory results. 
Different kinds of information can be concluded, 
like: estimate collision using velocity of departure factor, 
tracking of objects in 2 or 3 dimensions and departure distance
relative to the first position of $ROI$. 
The simulations in both cases has given promissory results.
