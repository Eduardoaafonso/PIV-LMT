The $PIV$ technique has presented satisfactory results. 
Different kinds of information that can 
be concluded, like: estimate collision using velocity of departure factor, 
tracking of objects in 2 or 3 dimensions and departure distance
relative to the first position of $ROI$. 
The simulations in both cases has given promissory results.
