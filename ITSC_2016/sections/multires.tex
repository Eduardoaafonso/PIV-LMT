\subsection{MULTI-SCALE MATCH CRITERION}
In the presented algorithm, the match criterion to track targets is based on the $PIV$ technique, 
where two image regions are defined, the $ROI$ and a $WOS$. 
The highest value of correlation ($PCC$) between the $ROI$ (Containing the target) and a $WOS$  
identifies the target, and determines the target location.

Fig. \ref{fig:multires}(a) shows an application in two dimensions, where
the regions are compared with a $ROI$ using the same scale.

The Fig. \ref{fig:multires}(b) reveals how the dimension of depth was included and
the search is made in different scales (layers). Similarly to the two dimension case, 
in three dimensions the target is also found through the highest $PCC$, but this may be
found in an analysis region bigger or smaller than in the last match.
