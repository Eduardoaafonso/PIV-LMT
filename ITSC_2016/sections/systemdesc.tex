The purpose of this algorithm is to make a 3D tracking objects, producing position informations 
about the followed target.
These informations will be relevant to define the parameters 
as: the relative velocity, the factor of approaching and of departure.

The proposed algorithm begin with a key frame image where a initial Region Of Interest ($ROI$) is determined; 
the system then receive a stream of image frames and the tracking system 
enters in looping to follow the target in the frames as is shown in the Fig. \ref{fig:system}.


\begin{figure}[bhp]

\caption{With a current $ROI$ selected, a highest value of $PCC$, between the $ROI$ 
and the Window Of Search ($WOS$) of next frame, identifies the target; 
the result of search is a displacement vector
between the first and last position of object. 
After, this processing is made again to the next frames.}

In a 2 dimensional analysis, the tracked objects given us information about your horizontal 
and vertical position and relative velocity respect to the observer.
When the target is analyzed in 3 dimensions, 
the initial $ROI$ has the position $(x,y,d=1)$;
where, $x$ and $y$ represent a position (horizontal and vertical) in the analyzed image,
and $d=1$ represents the initial depth position of object in the $ROI$.
Thus, all the results of depth will be relatives to this value, 
In this sense only can be calculated relative values of
velocity and the factor of approaching or departure.
