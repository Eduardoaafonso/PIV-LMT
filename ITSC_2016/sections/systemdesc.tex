The purpose of this algorithm is to make 3D tracking objects, producing added informations 
about the followed target.


They are important to define the parameters used to generate the tracking of 
objects and other details as: the relative velocity, the factor of 
approaching and of departure

With ROI determined, the system enters in looping to follow the target as shown 
in the Fig. \ref{fig:system}.


\begin{figure}[bhp]

\caption{With object detected, the highest value of PCC in the Window Of Search 
(WOS) of next frame identifies the target, 
and the result of search is a vector. 
Which its beginning and its end are on the first and last position, respectively. 
After, these processing is made again for 
next frames.}

In 2 dimensions, the objects are tracking and given information about its horizontal 
or vertical relative velocity.
When the target moves in 3 dimensions, outputs are the resultant of relative 
velocity and the factor of approaching or departure. 
There isn't a factor in 2 dimensions, since approaching or departure don't exist 
in this situation.

The algorithm developed takes as initial input a key frame with a Region Of 
Interesting ($ROI$) at the position $(x,y,1)$.
Where, $x$ and $y$ represent a position (line and column) in analyzed image,
and $1$ represents the initial deepest position of object in the $ROI$.
