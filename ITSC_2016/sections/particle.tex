\subsection{PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY}

$PIV$ is a technique to determine the  velocity field of objects from a stream of images.\cite{Bastiaans}.
This result is given as a vector field, showing for each particle, direction, sense and intensity of velocity. 
Moreover, it is possible to calculate rapidly the velocities of any object int the image.
For this purpose, the $PIV$ technique divides the image in analysis regions (particles), 
and are searched similarities to these particles in between two consecutive images 
(the current image in the stream and the previous); 
when matches are found, displacement vectors (vector field) are returned,
the analysis regions are refresh and the process is repeated with the consecutive image.
