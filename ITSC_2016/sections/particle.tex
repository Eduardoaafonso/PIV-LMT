\subsection{PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY - PIV}

PIV is a method to determine a velocity field from images of seeded flows\cite{Bastiaans}.
Its result is given as as field of vectors, demonstrating direction, sense and intensity of velocity in each particle. Moreover,
it is possible to calculate rapidly the velocities of any part of image.\\
