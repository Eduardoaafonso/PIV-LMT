\subsection{PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY}

$PIV$ is a method to determine a velocity field from images of seeded 
flows\cite{Bastiaans}.
Its result is given as field of vectors, demonstrating direction, sense and 
intensity of velocity in each particle. 
Moreover, it is possible to calculate rapidly the velocities of any part of image.\\
