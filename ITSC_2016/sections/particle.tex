\subsection{PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY}

$PIV$ is a technique to determine a velocity field from a stream of consecutive 
images of seeded flows\cite{Bastiaans}.
This result is given as a vector field, demonstrating direction, sense and 
intensity of velocity in each particle. 
Moreover, it is possible to calculate rapidly the velocities of any part of image.
For this purpose, the $PIV$ technique divides the image in analysis regions (particles), 
and are searched similarities to these particles in the next image; 
when matches are found, displacement vectors (vector field) are returned,
the analysis regions are refresh and the process is repeated with the consecutive image.
