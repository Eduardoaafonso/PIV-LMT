\subsection{PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY}

$PIV$ is a technique to determine the  velocity field of objects from a stream of images\cite{Bastiaans}.
The result of the $PIV$ is given as a vector field, showing for each particle the direction, sense and intensity of velocity. 
Moreover, the $PIV$ can be calculated for of different objects in a same image.
For this purpose, the $PIV$ technique divides the image in analysis regions (particles), 
and similarities of these particles are sought in two consecutive images.
When matches are found displacement are returned as vector fields.
