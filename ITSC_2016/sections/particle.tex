\subsection{PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY}

$PIV$ is a technique to determine the  velocity field of particles from a stream of images\cite{Bastiaans}.
The $PIV$ technique divides the image in analysis regions (particles), 
and similarities of these particles are sought in two consecutive images.
When matches are found, displacement are returned.
The result of the $PIV$ is given as a vector field, showing for each particle, the direction, sense and intensity of velocity. 
Thus, $PIV$ can be used to track different targets in a same image.
