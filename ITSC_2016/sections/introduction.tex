\section{INTRODUCTION}

Monocular vision comes being a flourishing field in autonomous vehicles. 
Several applications have presented solutions to current problems. 
Although in systems  of low computational cost  are a challenge to field. 


The Particle Image Velocimetry ($PIV$)\cite{Bastiaans} technique is used in many fields of 
knowledge \cite{Story, Xu}, to calculate the velocity of fluids in different parts. 
Here, $PIV$ was adjusted for situation of autonomous vehicles, using as match rule 
the Pearson Correlation Coefficient ($PCC$)\cite{Miranda Neto} over the KITTI's 
bank of dates\cite{Geiger}.
