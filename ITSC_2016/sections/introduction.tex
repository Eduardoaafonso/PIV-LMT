\section{INTRODUCTION}

Traffic accident has been an important point to government. The world average of people
died at traffic is around 10 people per 100 thousand, but in countries, like Brazil, it can be worse.
In 2016, the group which compose the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution for
improve global road safety and they consider that 2011-2020 is Decade of Action for Road Safety.
Traffic jam is other problem faced by cities, it is caused by reckless drivers and accidents.
Many centers of research have been studying solutions to improve this condition and decrease the 
numbers of death and accidents.

Monocular vision is an emerging field in autonomous vehicles. 
Several application have presented solutions to current problems, 
however systems  of low computational cost remain a challenge.

Studies has been showed the use of FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays). In \cite{Honegger}, the platform process date of 
cameras configured in 127 frames per second and resolution 376x240. It calculates radial distortions, disparity estimation
and streaming of date. It is used in embedded systems because of low weight. Thus, there are some advances in this research 
that prove efficiency of this platform. Systems is capable of calculate a relative velocity of any object in the scene. 
It uses a relative distance between camera and object to estimate velocity on optic axis(Z) and axis X and Y.

Other approach about monocular distance and velocity estimation is made in \cite{Breugel}. Authors propose a conception of 
observability in image like basic requirement to estimate velocity and distance. Input must not be null and it is possible
identify using equation observability Gramian to linear systems and Lie Algebraic tools to non-linear systems. If 
number of terms linearly independents is equal of number of state system, so system is classified like observability and, 
consequently, velocity and distance must not be zero.

These studies contribute in field of vision monocular to estimation of distance and velocity of object in scene. 
Our contribution is propose an algorithm that calculate the relative distance with precision using technique of 
different fields.


The Particle Image Velocimetry ($PIV$)\cite{Bastiaans} technique is used in many fields of 
knowledge, \cite{Story, Xu}, to calculate the velocity of fluids in different parts. 
Here, $PIV$ was adjusted for the case of autonomous vehicles using matching criteria based on 
the Pearson Correlation Coefficient ($PCC$)\cite{Miranda Neto} over the KITTI dataset\cite{Geiger}.

We define some variable used in the paper. The object of interesting is called target.
The region of interesting (ROI) is part of image where the target is and
Window of Search (WOS) is a rectangle where the program will search the ROI.
