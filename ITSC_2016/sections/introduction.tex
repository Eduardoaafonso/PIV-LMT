\section{INTRODUCTION}

Traffic accident has been an important point to government. The world average of people
died at traffic is around 10 people per 100 thousand, but in countries, like Brazil, it can be worse.
In 2016, the group which compose the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution for
improve global road safety and they consider that 2011-2020 is Decade of Action for Road Safety.
Traffic jam is other problem faced by cities, it is caused by reckless drivers and accidents.
Many centers of research have been studying solutions to improve this condition and decrease the 
numbers of death and accidents.

Monocular vision comes is an emerging field in autonomous vehicles. 
Several application have presented solutions to current problems, 
however systems  of low computational cost remain a challenge. 


The Particle Image Velocimetry ($PIV$)\cite{Bastiaans} technique is used in many fields of 
knowledge, \cite{Story, Xu}, to calculate the velocity of fluids in different parts. 
Here, $PIV$ was adjusted for the case of autonomous vehicles using matching criteria based on 
the Pearson Correlation Coefficient ($PCC$)\cite{Miranda Neto} over the KITTI dataset\cite{Geiger}.

Here, we define some variable used in the paper. The object of interesting is called target.
The region of interesting (ROI) is part of image where the target is and
Window of Search (WOS) is a rectangle where the program will search the ROI.
