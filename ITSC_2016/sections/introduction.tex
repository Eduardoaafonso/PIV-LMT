\section{INTRODUCTION}

Monocular vision has been demonstrating a flourishing field in autonomous vehicles. Several applications have presented  
solutions to current problems. Although systems of low computational cost and effectivity are a challenge to field. \\
The Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)\cite{Bastiaans} is used in many fields of knowledge \cite{Story, Xu}, to calculate 
the velocity of fluids in different parts. Here, PIV was adjusted for situation of autonomous vehicles, using PCC
\cite{Miranda Neto} and KITTI's bank of dates\cite{Geiger}.\\
