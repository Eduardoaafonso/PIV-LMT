\section{INTRODUCTION}

Monocular vision comes being a flourishing field in autonomous vehicles. 
Several applications have presented solutions to current problems. 
Although in systems  of low computational cost remain a challenge. 


The Particle Image Velocimetry ($PIV$)\cite{Bastiaans} technique is used in many fields of 
knowledge, \cite{Story, Xu}, to calculate the velocity of fluids in different parts. 
Here, $PIV$ was adjusted for situation of autonomous vehicles, using a matching criteria based on 
the Pearson Correlation Coefficient ($PCC$)\cite{Miranda Neto} over the KITTI dataset\cite{Geiger}.

Here, we define some variable used in the paper. The object of interesting is called target.
The region of interesting (ROI) is part of image where the target is and
Window of Search (WOS) is a rectangle where the program will search the ROI.
