\subsection{ERROR REDUCTION}

In this section, we discuss about the error in analysis of the images. In this sense,
we can see that, the targets have different forms; however, 
a $ROI$ ever will have a rectangular form, so that certain areas will be more important of identify inside of $ROI$.
In Fig. \ref{fig:erroridentified}, there are some areas close of edges that target not occupies; they are
considered like error areas.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Illustration of $ROI$ with error areas close of edge.}
\label{fig:erroridentified}
\end{figure}

Whereas, two matrix with the same dimensions can be compared using $PCC$; 
this method of comparison doesn't generate information over the equality of the frames,
but It shows if the frames have a proportional changes for pixel values in the same position. 
Thus, if we consider a high percentage of error area when we compare the frames, It may cause 
decreasing of the correlation level between frames and will given us a fake impression that the target is out of scene.  
We decide solve this problem using a weighting matrix mask over the analyzed regions, 
before the calculus of $PCC$. This can be seen in the Fig. \ref{fig:errorpondered}.
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/imageErrorcontroled.eps}
\caption{Illustration of points of most importance (red) and points less importance (blue) in correlation.}
\label{fig:errorpondered}
\end{figure}
Where, points close of edge (in blue color) are considered of less importance, 
points close of center of image (in red color) probably are on the target, and consequently
these points are considered with more importance. 

Thus, to create a weighting matrix mask $Q$ like the seen in the Fig.\ref{fig:errorpondered},
we calculate the $Q(x,y)$ value as showed in the Eq. (\ref{eq:Q}), 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Q}
 Q(x,y) = \sqrt{e^{ -\frac{|x-\mu_X|^3}{\sigma_X^3}-\frac{|y-\mu_Y|^3}{\sigma_Y^3}  }},
\end{equation}
where $Q(x,y)$ represents a value, in the line $x$ and column $y$,
$\mu_X=H/2$, $\mu_Y=W/2$, $\sigma_X=H/3$ and $\sigma_Y=W/3$; being $H$ and $W$
the height and the width, respectively, in the matrix (analysis region).

Finally, similarly to seen in the Eq. (\ref{eq:PCC}), we multiply the matrix $Q$, 
element by element, over the analysis regions
$A$ and $B$ to calculate the $r_Q$ weighted correlation coefficient, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rw}
 r_Q = PCC(Q~A, Q~B).
\end{equation}
