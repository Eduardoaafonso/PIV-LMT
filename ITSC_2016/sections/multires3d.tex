\subsubsection{MULTI-LAYER 3D APPROXIMATION}
The multi-layer is a technique to track objects that move in 3 dimensions. The layers are organized of the smallest to the biggest, 
there is a rate which layers increase. With this proceeding, the algorithm is capable of track objects that in second scene was larger than first.\\

\subsubsection{FACTOR OF APPROACHING - RELATIVE VELOCITY}
Factor of approaching is a dimensionless number related to the rate of approaching or departure of an object to the camera. The factor
is determined how showed at equation 2:

\begin{equation}
\centering
\everymath{\displaystyle}
f_a = \frac{Area_r}{Area_f} 
\end{equation}

Where $f_a$ is the factor of approaching, $Area_r$ is area of ROI and $Area_f$ is area of current frame.\\
The factor has two means, e.g., if the rate of approaching increase quickly, so the target is approaching. Or the apposite, if factor decreases, thus 
object is departing.\\
Relative velocity is calculate using a simples equation of kinematic in physics:


\begin{equation}
\centering
\everymath{\displaystyle}
 v = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}

Where $v$ is relative velocity, $\Delta s$ is difference in between two pixels and $\Delta t$ is time of proceeding.\\
Velocity calculated is relative for simple reason that it is impossible to know the real distance between the camera and object in this
condition.\\
