In this paper, the $PIV$ technique was adapted to be used in vehicles autonomous.
Applying $PIV$ and the Pearson correlation, the algorithm here presented 
is capable of making a 3D tracking the object and generates a relative departure factor. 
So that, the data are used to estimate relative velocity  of a target and analyze the 
collision risk.
