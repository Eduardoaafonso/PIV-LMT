In this paper, the Particle Image Velocimetry technique was adapted to be used in automated driving system.
The, applying $PIV$ and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, our proposed algorithm 
is capable of making a three dimensions tracking of a target 
and generates a relative departure factor. These data are used to estimate the 
relative velocity of the target.
