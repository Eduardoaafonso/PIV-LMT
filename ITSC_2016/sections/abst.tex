In this paper, the Particle Image Velocimetry ($PIV$) technique was adapted to be used in autonomous vehicles.
Thus, applying $PIV$ and the Pearson\'s Correlation Coefficient, our proposed algorithm 
is capable of making a three dimensions tracking of a target 
and generates a relative departure factor. These data are used to estimate the 
relative velocity of the target.
