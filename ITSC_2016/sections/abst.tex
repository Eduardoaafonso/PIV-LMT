In this paper, the Particle Image Velocimetry ($PIV$) technique was adapted to be used in autonomous vehicles.
Applying $PIV$ and the Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient, the algorithm here proposed  
is capable of making a three dimensional tracking of a target
and generates a relative departure factor. These data are used to estimate the 
relative velocity of the target and then analyze the collision risk.
