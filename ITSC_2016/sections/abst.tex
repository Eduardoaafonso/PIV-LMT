In this paper, the Particle Image Velocimetry ($PIV$) technique was adapted to be used in autonomous vehicles.
Applying PIV and the Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient, our proposed algorithm 
is capable of making a three dimensions tracking of the target possible (Region Of Interest) $ROI$ 
and generates a relative departure factor. These data are used to estimate the 
relative velocity of the target ($ROI$) and then analyse the collision risk.
