In this paper, the Particle Image Velocimetry ($PIV$) technique was adapted to be used in autonomous vehicles.
Applying PIV and the Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient, our proposed algorithm 
is capable of making a three dimensions tracking of a target (Region Of Interest - $ROI$) 
and generates a relative departure factor. These data are used to estimate the 
relative velocity of the target ($ROI$) and then analyze the collision risk.
