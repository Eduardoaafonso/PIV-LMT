The PIV is the tool used to calculate field of velocity in fluids and, in this paper, this tool was adopted to be used in vehicles autonomous.
Using PIV and PCC, the program is capable of tracking the object and generate a factor of approaching or departure, depending of case. So, 
the data are used to estimate velocity relative of target and risk of collision.
