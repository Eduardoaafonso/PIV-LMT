In this paper, the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique has been adapted to be used in automated driving systems.
The algorithm proposed here is capable of three-dimensional tracking of an object in the scene and generates an approximation factor.
These data are used to estimate the relative velocity of the target.
